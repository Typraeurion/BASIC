This BASIC interpreter (basic.y and its accompanying .c files) is
being released to the public under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 3 (https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0) by the
author (Trevin Beattie) after active development had been stalled for
over twenty years.

The example .BASIC code files are copied from “BASIC Computer Games”
and “More BASIC Computer Games” by author David H. Ahl.  These books
were released to the public domain on June 15, 2022 (according to a
post on Facebook — see:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/521427671543144/posts/1694495597569673/).

Jeff Atwood has started a project to port all of the games in these
two books to several more modern languages.  See:
